purpose: >
  Thread fixture_digest (content hash of fixture.json) through the search
  evidence binding corridor: graph metadata, tape header, verification report,
  and verify_bundle cross-checks. Closes the semantic gap where program,
  dimensions, and initial payload are not cryptographically bound into search
  artifacts. After this, world_id can safely become a family label without
  weakening verification.

non_goals:
  - "No schema version bump — fixture_digest is additive at the schema level (extensibility-safe)."
  - "No changes to the linear trace path (ByteTrace already has fixture_hash)."
  - "No changes to kernel crate."

design:
  binding_definition: >
    fixture_digest = binding_hex(canonical_hash(DOMAIN_BUNDLE_ARTIFACT, fixture_json_bytes)).
    Raw hex in graph metadata and tape header (no sha256: prefix). Full sha256:hex in
    verification report (matching scorer/operator digest convention). These are distinct
    encodings under the same semantic name, following existing corridor convention.
  backward_compat: >
    Emitted always in new bundles. Base profile: required-if-present (old bundles without
    fixture_digest pass Step 12). Cert profile: mandatory (fixture_digest must be present
    in graph metadata and tape header; absence fails verification). Golden fixtures are
    regenerated because canonical JSON bytes change (new field in metadata), even though
    the schema is additive.
  trust_boundary: >
    fixture_digest pins declared configuration (dimensions, initial payload, program), not
    code behavior. enumerate_candidates(), is_goal(), and scoring logic are code-determined.
    A code change can still produce a self-verifying bundle. This is the explicit builder-trust
    boundary.
  tape_render: >
    tape_render.rs extracts fixture_digest from header as optional field (like
    operator_set_digest/scorer_digest). Old tapes without the field render correctly.
    Cert equivalence is maintained because build_tape_header and render_graph both
    propagate the same field.
  report_binding: >
    fixture_digest added to verification_report.json (full sha256:hex format, like
    scorer_digest and operator_set_digest), for third-party consumers who want to
    authenticate fixture identity from the report alone.

invariants:
  - "INV-BIND-01: fixture_digest is binding_hex(fixture.json artifact content_hash), not DOMAIN_HARNESS_FIXTURE or any other domain."
  - "INV-BIND-02: Base: required-if-present (Step 12). Cert: mandatory in graph metadata and tape header (Steps 12, 18)."
  - "INV-BIND-03: fixture_digest is policy-independent — same world under different policies produces identical fixture_digest."
  - "INV-BIND-04: tape_render.rs propagates fixture_digest from header to rendered graph metadata (Cert equivalence)."
  - "INV-BIND-05: schema_descriptor is cross-checked in tape↔graph Step 16d (fail-closed, both sides required)."
