threats:
  - "Search crate accidentally depending on harness (breaks one-way dependency invariant)"
  - "HashMap iteration order in frontier or visited set breaking determinism"
  - "Float scores leaking into Cert-mode ordering"
  - "Silent pruning or rejection without graph recording (hidden router)"
  - "World enumerate_candidates using stale or split-brain registry"
  - "Dead-end tagging claiming semantic impossibility when expansion was budget-limited"
invariants:
  - "INV-SC-01: Given identical (root_state, policy, scorer), search produces identical SearchGraphV1 bytes"
  - "INV-SC-02: Worlds MUST enumerate only candidates whose op_code exists in the runner-supplied RegistryV1; illegal candidates terminate with WorldContractViolation"
  - "INV-SC-03: Every frontier pop and every candidate decision is recorded as ExpandEventV1 + CandidateRecordV1; no silent pruning"
  - "INV-SC-04: Every candidate score carries deterministic provenance (ScoreSourceV1); learned bias is recorded, not hidden"
  - "INV-SC-05: state_fingerprint is computed from the policy-declared dedup key (DedupKeyV1) and recorded in metadata"
  - "INV-SC-06: Frontier selection order matches recorded expansion_order in the graph; no hidden decision pathway"
  - "INV-SC-07: Dead-end is tagged Exhaustive only if expansion completed without caps; BudgetLimited otherwise"
  - "INV-SC-08: Candidate enumeration uses the runner-supplied RegistryV1 snapshot only; no split-brain registry reads"
  - "INV-SC-09: node_summaries emitted in strict node_id ascending order"
  - "INV-SC-10: DedupKeyV1::FullState and PruneVisitedPolicyV1::ReleaseVisited are hard errors in M1"
  - "sterling_search depends on sterling_kernel only; it does NOT depend on sterling_harness"
  - "Neural/learned scoring is advisory only: cannot create actions, bypass legality, or suppress candidates"
