purpose: >
  Introduce a stochastic truth-regime world that forces "certification binds to
  evidence, not environment" — the hardest evidence model. The agent moves on a
  grid where transitions slip with probability p: the intended direction succeeds
  with probability (1-p), and each of the other directions gets probability p/3.
  The key design constraint: replay must be able to independently verify every
  transition outcome without access to the original runtime environment.

  Option 1 (precommitted RNG witness stream) is chosen over Option 2 (seed +
  deterministic PRNG) because it makes the randomness surface explicitly auditable
  — the witness stream IS the evidence, not a derived computation from a seed.
  This aligns with the "no hidden semantics" principle: the verifier can check
  each outcome against the witness without needing to know which PRNG algorithm
  was used or reimplementing it identically.

  This is the third truth-regime world (after TOOLSCRIPT-001 tool safety and
  POBS-001 epistemic). It validates that the three-way authority division
  (ADR 0009) scales to stochastic domains and that the derived-artifact corridor
  pattern is reusable across all truth regimes.

depends_on:
  - "TOOLSCRIPT-001: Established derived-artifact corridor pattern (obligation → render → equivalence)."
  - "POBS-001: Established winning-path replay witness and ReplayInvariantChecker trait."
  - "ADR 0009: Truth-regime authority division (kernel/world/verifier)."
  - "ADR 0008: Additive field extension for new binding fields."
  - "ByteTraceFooterV1.witness_store_digest: Already in wire format, currently always None."

non_goals:
  - "No changes to compile() semantics or CompilationResultV1."
  - "No changes to SearchGraphV1 or SearchTapeV1 schema versions — new fields are additive (ADR 0008)."
  - "No epistemic + stochastic combination world — single truth regime per world."
  - "No continuous action spaces — discrete grid directions only."
  - "No learned policies — uniform or table scorer only."
  - "No multi-agent stochastic games — single agent."
  - "No online learning or reward shaping — fixed transition probabilities."

design:
  architectural_posture: >
    This spec exercises the stochastic evidence boundary: can replay prove that
    recorded transition outcomes match what the authoritative randomness source
    produced? The answer is yes if and only if the randomness source is committed
    before search and shipped with the bundle. The precommitted witness stream
    achieves this without requiring PRNG algorithm identity between producer and
    verifier.

    The three-way authority division (ADR 0009) governs:
    - Kernel: New OP_MOVE operator with EffectKind::RecordsTransitionOutcome.
      Enforces exactly 1 position slot write per move. Does NOT validate whether
      the written position matches the witness — that is the verifier's job.
    - World: Consumes witness entries during enumerate_candidates() to determine
      actual transition outcomes. Encodes the outcome position in OP_MOVE args.
    - Verifier: During replay, re-reads witness entries and checks that the
      OP_MOVE args match. Checks distributional properties of the witness stream.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Witness Stream Design (Option 1: Precommitted RNG Tape)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  witness_stream: >
    The witness stream is an ordered sequence of transition outcomes, one per
    agent move. Each entry contains:
      { step: u64, intended_direction: Code32, actual_direction: Code32, slip: bool }

    The stream is generated before search begins (or lazily during search from a
    seed, but the FULL stream is committed before bundling). The stream is
    serialized as canonical JSON and hashed. The hash is committed in two places:
    (1) ByteTraceFooterV1.witness_store_digest (upstream, baked into trace hash),
    (2) stochastic_witness.json normative artifact in the bundle (downstream,
    bound via report digest + Cert equivalence render).

    Why precommitted and not recomputed-from-seed:
    - The verifier never needs to know the PRNG algorithm or seed.
    - The witness IS the evidence — tamper = hash mismatch, omit = obligation fail.
    - Future portability: if the PRNG implementation changes, old bundles remain
      verifiable because the witness stream was committed, not the algorithm.

    Implementation note: the world MAY internally use a seed + PRNG to generate
    the witness stream. But the committed artifact is the stream, not the seed.
    The seed is an implementation detail, not an evidence surface.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Grid World Design
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  grid_world: >
    The world is a 2D grid (N×N) with a start position and goal position.
    The agent chooses a cardinal direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) each step.
    With probability (1-p), the move succeeds. With probability p, the agent
    slips to a uniformly random other direction. Walls are absorbing (move into
    wall = stay in place).

    State layout:
    - Layer 0: goal position (Provisional at compile time, write-protected)
    - Layer 1: agent position + move history
      - Slot 0: current position (row * N + col, encoded as Code32)
      - Slots 1..MAX_STEPS: outcome record per step (actual_direction Code32)
      - Slot MAX_STEPS+1: completion marker (solved marker or step-budget marker)

    Goal predicate: agent position == goal position.

    Default regime: 5×5 grid, start=(0,0), goal=(4,4), slip_probability=0.2,
    max_steps=50. This is small enough for exhaustive search but large enough
    that slip effects are observable in the witness stream.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Operator Design
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  operators: >
    One new operator:

    OP_MOVE = Code32::new(1, 3, 1)
      EffectKind: RecordsTransitionOutcome
      Args: move_args(layer: u32, position_slot: u32, history_slot: u32,
                      intended_direction: Code32, actual_position: Code32)
      Byte count: 24 (6 × 4 bytes)

      Kernel enforcement (EffectKind::RecordsTransitionOutcome):
      - Exactly 2 identity diffs (position slot + history slot)
      - Exactly 2 status diffs (both Hole → Provisional or position overwrite)
      - Position slot is slot 0 on the specified layer
      - History slot is sequential (step 1 → slot 1, step 2 → slot 2, etc.)

      Note: position slot IS overwritten on each move — this is the ONE exception
      to the write-once rule. The kernel needs to allow Provisional → Provisional
      for the position slot specifically. This is a new EffectKind semantic:
      "position slot may be rewritten, history slots are write-once."

      Alternative (simpler, avoids write-once exception):
      OP_MOVE only writes the history slot (1 diff). Position is computed from
      history during is_goal() and replay. Position is implicit, not in state.

      DECISION NEEDED: explicit position slot (richer state, write-once exception)
      vs implicit position (simpler kernel, computed during goal check).

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Evidence Obligations
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  evidence_obligations: >
    The stochastic world declares two evidence obligations:
    - "stochastic_witness_v1": witness stream artifact must be present and
      digest-bound in the verification report.
    - "winning_path_replay_v1": winning-path replay with StochasticInvariantChecker.

    The runner renders stochastic_witness.json from the tape + original witness
    stream. The verifier checks:
    Step 22: stochastic_witness.json digest binding (report field + artifact hash).
    Step 23: Cert-only equivalence render (re-render from tape, compare bytes).
    Step 24: Cert-only replay invariant check (verify each OP_MOVE against witness).

    Belt-and-suspenders: if tape contains OP_MOVE (applied candidates with
    Code32::new(1,3,1)), but evidence_obligations doesn't declare
    "stochastic_witness_v1", Cert fails with ObligationMismatch.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Stochastic Witness Artifact Schema
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  artifact_schema: >
    stochastic_witness.json canonical JSON:
    {
      "schema_version": "stochastic_witness.v1",
      "world_id": "stochastic_grid:v1:...",
      "grid_size": 5,
      "slip_probability": 0.2,
      "start_position": [0, 0],
      "goal_position": [4, 4],
      "entry_count": N,
      "entries": [
        {
          "step": 0,
          "intended_direction": "UP",
          "actual_direction": "RIGHT",
          "slip": true
        },
        ...
      ],
      "slip_count": M,
      "solved": true,
      "total_steps": N
    }

    The artifact is normative — included in the bundle digest basis.
    The report binds via "stochastic_witness_digest": "<hash>".

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Invariant Checker
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  invariant_checker: >
    StochasticInvariantChecker implements ReplayInvariantChecker.
    Constructor takes the witness stream entries.

    On each OP_MOVE step:
    1. Look up witness entry by step_index.
    2. Verify intended_direction matches the OP_MOVE arg.
    3. Verify actual_position matches what the witness entry's actual_direction
       would produce from the previous position on the grid.
    4. Track slip count.

    After all steps: verify total slip count matches witness aggregate.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # ByteTrace witness_store_digest Activation
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  witness_binding: >
    The witness stream hash is committed in ByteTraceFooterV1.witness_store_digest.
    This is the upstream binding — it is baked into the trace payload hash, which
    flows into fixture_digest → graph metadata → tape header → report (the full
    upstream corridor). Currently always None; the stochastic world is the first
    to populate it.

    The runner computes:
      witness_hash = canonical_hash(DOMAIN_WITNESS_STORE, witness_stream_bytes)
    and sets footer.witness_store_digest = Some(witness_hash).

    Verification (Cert): the verifier checks that the
    ByteTrace.footer.witness_store_digest matches the hash of the witness stream
    reconstructed from the tape. This is an upstream binding check (analogous to
    fixture_digest in graph metadata).

invariants:
  - >-
    INV-STOCH-01: Witness stream is precommitted. The canonical hash of the
    witness stream bytes is committed in ByteTraceFooterV1.witness_store_digest
    BEFORE search begins. The witness stream is the authoritative randomness
    source — the verifier never needs the seed or PRNG algorithm.
  - >-
    INV-STOCH-02: Each OP_MOVE writes exactly 1 history slot (Hole→Provisional).
    No slot is written twice. Position is implicit (computed from move history),
    not stored in state, avoiding write-once exceptions.
  - >-
    INV-STOCH-03: OP_MOVE kernel dispatch does not read the witness stream or
    validate transition correctness. The kernel enforces write-surface bounds
    (1 identity diff, 1 status diff). Truth-dependent validation (does the
    recorded outcome match the witness?) is the verifier's job via replay.
  - >-
    INV-STOCH-04: Stochastic witness entries are consumed in order during
    enumerate_candidates(). Step index in witness entry matches expansion
    step index. No skipping, no reordering.
  - >-
    INV-STOCH-05: Replay invariant checker independently verifies each
    transition outcome against the witness stream. Intended direction from
    OP_MOVE args must match witness entry. Actual outcome position must match
    witness entry's actual_direction applied to grid.
  - >-
    INV-STOCH-06: Existing worlds with evidence_obligations: [] continue to
    build and verify without changes. witness_store_digest: None is the default.
    No regressions.
  - >-
    INV-STOCH-07: stochastic_witness.json bytes equal independently rendered
    witness bytes (Cert equivalence, downstream binding convention). Witness is
    rendered from tape + committed witness stream.
  - >-
    INV-STOCH-08: Belt-and-suspenders: if tape contains OP_MOVE applied
    candidates but evidence_obligations does not declare "stochastic_witness_v1",
    Cert fails with ObligationMismatch. Prevents silent obligation stripping.

      Witness stream generation is O(max_steps). Replay cost is O(path_length *
      apply_cost) plus witness lookup (O(1) per step via index). For the default
      5x5 grid with max_steps=50, this is negligible. Witness stream storage is
      O(max_steps * entry_size) — for 50 entries at ~64 bytes each, ~3.2 KB.

  security:
    note: >-
      Witness stream is precommitted and hash-bound into the trace corridor
      (ByteTrace footer). Tampering with the witness changes the trace hash,
      which cascades through fixture_digest → graph metadata → tape header →
      report. The verifier independently checks each transition against the
      witness. The kernel never reads the witness — no semantic leak channel.
      Belt-and-suspenders prevents obligation stripping.

      Explicit position slot (richer state, requires write-once exception for

    recommendation: >
      Implicit position is simpler and avoids introducing a Provisional→Provisional
      rewrite exception. Position can be computed from start + cumulative move
      history. The history slots are write-once (Hole→Provisional), consistent
      with every other world. The EffectKind then only needs 1 diff (history slot),
      matching the simplest existing pattern (WritesOneSlotFromArgs).

      Should the witness stream be generated lazily during search (from an

      Lazy generation + post-search commitment is fine as long as the committed
      artifact is the STREAM, not the seed. The verifier never sees the seed.
      Pre-generation is conceptually cleaner but wastes memory for long max_steps
      budgets. Either way, the evidence surface is identical.
