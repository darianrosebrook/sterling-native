threats:
  - "Search crate accidentally depending on harness (breaks one-way dependency invariant)"
  - "HashMap iteration order in frontier or visited set breaking determinism"
  - "Float scores leaking into Cert-mode ordering"
  - "Silent pruning or rejection without graph recording (hidden router)"
  - "World enumerate_candidates using stale or split-brain registry"
  - "Dead-end tagging claiming semantic impossibility when expansion was budget-limited"
invariants:
  - "INV-SC-01: Given identical (root_state, policy, scorer), search produces identical SearchGraphV1 bytes"
  - "INV-SC-02: Worlds MUST enumerate only candidates whose op_code exists in the runner-supplied RegistryV1; illegal candidates terminate with WorldContractViolation"
  - "INV-SC-03: Every frontier pop and every candidate decision is recorded as ExpandEventV1 + CandidateRecordV1; no silent pruning"
  - "INV-SC-04: Every candidate score carries deterministic provenance (ScoreSourceV1); learned bias is recorded, not hidden"
  - "INV-SC-05: state_fingerprint is computed from the policy-declared dedup key (DedupKeyV1) and recorded in metadata"
  - "INV-SC-06: Frontier selection order matches recorded expansion_order in the graph; no hidden decision pathway"
  - "INV-SC-07: Dead-end is tagged Exhaustive only if expansion completed without caps; BudgetLimited otherwise"
  - "INV-SC-08: Candidate enumeration uses the runner-supplied RegistryV1 snapshot only; no split-brain registry reads"
  - "INV-SC-09: node_summaries emitted in strict node_id ascending order"
  - "INV-SC-10: DedupKeyV1::FullState and PruneVisitedPolicyV1::ReleaseVisited are hard errors in M1"
  - "sterling_search depends on sterling_kernel only; it does NOT depend on sterling_harness"
  - "Neural/learned scoring is advisory only: cannot create actions, bypass legality, or suppress candidates"
  - "INV-SC-M33-01: SearchHealthMetricsV1 is a pure function of SearchGraphV1 (expansions + node_summaries only); no runtime state, no metadata counters"
  - "INV-SC-M33-02: Health metrics are DIAGNOSTIC; must not participate in any binding digest; verification must not fail due to metrics content"
  - "INV-SC-M33-03: Health metrics serialization is deterministic across platforms; no HashMap iteration; histogram arrays sorted by key ascending"
  # --- M4: Tape Evidence Chain ---
  - "INV-SC-M4-01: run_search() always produces a tape via search_with_tape(); tape bytes are included as a normative bundle artifact"
  - "INV-SC-M4-02: Tape chain hash integrity is verified by verify_bundle() when search_tape.stap is present; tampered tape fails verification"
  - "INV-SC-M4-03: Tape header bindings (world_id, schema_descriptor, registry_digest, policy_snapshot_digest, search_policy_digest, root_state_fingerprint, scorer_digest) match corresponding verification_report fields"
  - "INV-SC-M4-04: Tape-rendered SearchGraphV1 canonical JSON bytes are identical to the direct search_graph.json artifact bytes (tape→graph equivalence)"
  - "INV-SC-M4-05: Cert/strict verification profile requires tape presence; base profile accepts tape-absent bundles from prior milestones"
