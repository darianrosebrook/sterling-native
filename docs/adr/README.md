# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture decisions that are:
- irreversible or costly to reverse,
- foundational to invariants/contracts,
- likely to be questioned later.

Conventions:
- One decision per ADR.
- Include alternatives considered.
- Include explicit consequences.
- Link to the canonical contract(s) affected.
