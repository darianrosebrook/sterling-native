# Capability Primitive Specs Bundle

Version: v0.4
Date: 2026-02-01

This bundle is generated from the current capability primitive catalog and the Minecraft rig catalog. It is intended to reduce drift by freezing each primitive into an implementation spec with certification gates and I/O contract fragments.

Start here:
- `philosophy.md` — **Capability ingestion philosophy**: boundary separations, absorption pipeline, domain coupling prevention rules, and how rigs become Sterling capability
- `00_INDEX.md`
- `00_IO_CONTRACT.md`
- `templates/global_invariants.md`
- `templates/rig_template_A_to_H.md`

Notes:
- P21 is included as a *draft* based on the current Entity Belief Tracking discussion; it is not yet canonical in the source catalogs.

Additional compiled formats:
- Capability_Primitive_Specs_v0_2.docx
- Capability_Primitive_Specs_v0_2.pdf
