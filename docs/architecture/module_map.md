# Module Map (Sterling Native)

Short navigational map of the 7-module target architecture.

- carrier: ByteState/ByteTrace, compilation boundary, schema + registry snapshots
- state: view/schema types over carrier state (no alternative runtime truth)
- operators: typed signatures, registry, builtin + induced operator families
- search: single search engine; instrumentation via hooks, not forks
- proof: canonical hashing, certificates, provenance, governance policy + verdicts
- worlds: adapters + Unified World Harness; MetaPlan for composition
- ml: advisory-only parsing/scoring/realization (no mutation authority)
