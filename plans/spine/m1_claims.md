# M1 Claim Catalog

> What Sterling Native is allowed to say after M1 is complete.
> Each claim has a falsifier: a concrete way to disprove it.

## M1-CLAIM-001: Compilation boundary determinism

**Statement**: `compile(payload_bytes, schema_descriptor, registry_snapshot)` is a pure function for the Rome payload shape; identical inputs produce identical `ByteStateV1` bytes.

**Falsifier**: Run compile() with identical inputs in two environments (different process, different cwd, different OS). If evidence bytes or digests differ, the claim is false.

**Required artifacts**: S1-M1-DETERMINISM-INPROC, S1-M1-DETERMINISM-CROSSPROC, S1-M1-DETERMINISM-CROSSOS results.

## M1-CLAIM-002: V1 hash parity

**Statement**: All content/state/registry hashing uses SHA-256 with the exact V1 domain-separation prefix bytes (null-terminated), producing `"sha256:<lowercase hex>"` outputs that match v1 oracle outputs.

**Falsifier**: Compute `sha256(prefix || data)` for the same inputs in both v1 Python and Native Rust. If any digest differs, the claim is false. The prefix bytes must include the null terminator.

**Required artifacts**: S1-M1-HASH-V1-VECTORS golden test vectors (>=3), generated offline by v1.

## M1-CLAIM-003: No second-truth JSON trace

**Statement**: M1 does not introduce an alternate "JSON trace" representation that can diverge from the binary carrier; only descriptors and manifests may be JSON.

**Falsifier**: Search the kernel crate for any JSON structure that encodes ByteState content (identity/status plane data) or ByteTrace frame content. If found, the claim is false. Descriptors (schema_descriptor, registry_snapshot) and compilation manifests are permitted.

**Required artifacts**: S1-M1-ONE-CANONICALIZER structural test, code review.

## M1-CLAIM-004: Fail-closed compilation

**Statement**: Invalid payload/schema/registry inputs do not emit partial `ByteState` and do not panic; they return typed `CompilationFailure` variants.

**Falsifier**: For each invalid input class (schema mismatch, registry mismatch, unknown Code32, constraint violation, malformed JSON), call compile(). If any call panics, returns Ok, or produces partial state bytes, the claim is false.

**Required artifacts**: S1-M1-FAILCLOSED, S1-M1-TYPED-FAILURES mutation test results.

## Admissibility

A claim is admissible only when:
1. All required artifacts exist and pass in CI.
2. Golden fixtures were generated by an oracle outside the Native build graph.
3. The Native code is constrained by the fixtures (would fail if canonicalization/hashing drifted).
4. No manual steps are required beyond `cargo test --workspace`.
